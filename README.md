Super Mario Sunset was a New Super Mario Bros. U mod that I started in 2022. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, I cancelled the mod. This is a release of everything in the mod that was finished enough to be somewhat presentable.

If you've seen old videos of this mod, you'll quickly notice that the files in this repo are all that were backed up -- the latest files are lost forever, meaning that anything here is relatively outdated.

The music archive `cafe_redpro_sound.bfsar` is too big to put on GitHub as-is. While I can put it in the release, I can't put it in the source tree. Instead, I've split the file into pieces. Run the `setup_music` python script to rejoin those files.


This mod requires [Tsuru](https://github.com/zenith-team/tsuru). Though I wrote a lot of code for this mod (which can be found [here](https://github.com/Swiftshine/Sprites/tree/main/NSMBU)), none of it actually ended up being used. This means you can simply use the official Tsuru repo.
